WEATHER APPLICATION FOR STUDENT --- GROUP 37

This is a simple weather application created for students.

The best part of this app is that students can control what type of information they get. From weekly overview, hourly forecast, to minute-by-minute updates.

TO RUN THE APPLICATION:

	- Create an empty folder and download the submitted files.
	
	- Extract the "node_modules.rar" file into the newly created folder (may require softwares like WinRAR or WinZip). 
		(Cannot zip the file into the .zip format because it would exceed the file limit on QMPlus).
	
	- Extract the "core_files.zip" file into the newly created folder.

	- Simply open the newly created folder in your terminal and type:

		npm run dev

	- The application runs perfectly with the Chrome browser if you choose "Iphone 6/7/8 Plus" as the view mode 
	(On Chrome: Right click --> Inspect (Ctrl+Shift+I) --> Choose "Iphone 6/7/8 Plus" )
	
	- If you want to run it with your phone, type:

		npm run start

	- Make sure your phone and your computer are connected to the same network. A link to run the application will be given to you in the console. 

	- Just put that IP address in your mobile browser and test your web application.
	
	- In case the methods above do not work, the code is also uploaded to Google Drive with the following link:
